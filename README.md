# nim

Code for:
- Mex function (and XOR and mex equivalence fxn)
- Calculating Sprague-Grundy values for Nim and Wythoff's Nim
- Encoding XOR and Fibonnaci sequence/Golden ratio using Nim winning positions

2-heap Nim:

Wythoff's Nim:

Todo:
- [x] Derive proof for Beatty's theorem (on paper, explains why golden ratio can be used to find winning solution to Wythoff's Nim)
- [x] Bot that wins every time by reducing XOR to 0 at each move

Thanks to Professor Paul Zeitz for introducing this problem to me!
